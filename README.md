A desktop application to help you cheat on everything, but there's a twist: we have integration with Google Drive, Calendar, and other Google services.

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher) installed on your computer
- Git installed on your computer
- OpenAI API key (get it from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))
- Google Maps API key (optional, for location features)
- Google OAuth credentials (for Google Drive and Calendar integration)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd cluely-clone
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   Create a file named `.env` in the root folder and add:
   ```env
   # Required
   VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   
   # Optional (for location features)
   VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key_here
   GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key_here
   
   # For Google OAuth (if using Google services)
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id_here
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret_here
   ```

4. **Set up the database:**
   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   npx prisma db push
   ```

## Running the App

### Method 1: Development Mode (Recommended for first run)
1. Open a terminal and run:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start both the Vite dev server and Electron app automatically.

### Method 2: Manual Development Mode
If you prefer to run them separately:
1. Start the Vite dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev:vite
   ```
2. In another terminal, start Electron:
   ```bash
   npm run dev:electron
   ```

### Method 3: Production Mode
```bash
npm run build
npm run dist
```
The built app will be in the `release` folder.
