# Audio Recording & Analysis Guide

## Overview
Your app now has audio recording and analysis functionality using OpenAI's Whisper API for transcription and GPT-4 for intelligent responses. This is perfect for interview preparation, voice notes, and getting AI assistance through voice input.

## Setup Requirements
