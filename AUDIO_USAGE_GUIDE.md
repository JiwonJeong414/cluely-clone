# Audio Recording & Analysis Guide

## Overview
Your app now has audio recording and analysis functionality using OpenAI's Whisper API for transcription and GPT-4 for intelligent responses. This is perfect for interview preparation, voice notes, and getting AI assistance through voice input.

## Setup Requirements

### 1. OpenAI API Key
Make sure you have a `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY` in your `.env` file:
```
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

**Note**: The app will also check for `OPENAI_API_KEY` as a fallback, but `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY` is preferred.

### 2. How to Use

1. **Start the app**: Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
2. **Find the microphone button**: Look for the ðŸŽ¤ icon next to the chat input field
