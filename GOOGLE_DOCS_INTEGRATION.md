# Google Docs Integration

## Overview

The Wingman application now includes automatic Google Docs note creation for screenshots and audio captures. After capturing a screenshot or recording audio, Wingman will automatically create a Google Doc with the analysis and store it in your Google Drive.

## Features

### Automatic Note Creation

1. **Screenshot Notes**: When you capture a screenshot, Wingman will:
   - Analyze the screenshot using AI vision
   - Create a Google Doc with the analysis
   - Include the original screenshot URL and user question
   - Format the document with proper styling

2. **Audio Notes**: When you record audio, Wingman will:
   - Transcribe the audio
   - Analyze the transcription with AI
   - Create a Google Doc with both transcription and analysis
   - Include metadata like recording duration

3. **Conversation Notes**: For substantial conversations, Wingman will:
   - Create a Google Doc with the full conversation
   - Include AI analysis and insights
   - Format with user and assistant messages clearly separated

### User Interface

- **Notification System**: Shows success/error messages when creating notes
- **Loading Indicator**: Displays "Creating Google Doc..." while processing
- **Recent Docs Button**: Click the üìù button to view recent Google Docs
- **Direct Access**: Click on any recent doc to open it in Google Docs

## How It Works

## Google Docs Format

Each Google Doc is formatted with:
- **Title**: Styled as a Google Docs title
